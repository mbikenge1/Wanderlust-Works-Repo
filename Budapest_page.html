      <h1> Hearty meat dishes are this city's USP. But the best restaurants in Budapest will suit vegans and carnivores alike.
        <br>
        Eating on the cheap comes naturally in the Budapest. Hearty Hungarian staples like <i>kolbasz</i> (spiced sausages) and <i>kacsamell</i>
        (seared duck breast) are always keenly priced, and even this foodie city's legion of Michelin star recipients go suprisingly easy on the wallet.
        <br>
        Menus tend to be meat-heavy, but there are plentiful vegan and vegetarian options too. Happily, some of the best restaurants in Budapest also
        draw inspiration from the city's sizeable Jewish community, with Mediterranean and Israeli-leaning sharing plates a locals'go-to. We're
        pretty sure we haven't had better mezze.

        <p><b>What's the deal?</b> A spacious glass-roof restaurant that serves a moreish hybrid of Israeli-Mediterranean food and totally on-point
          coctails.
        <b>Why go?</b> If dining in a huge, open-plan courtyard peppered with plans is your thing, head here. Opt for the falafel burger in a sweet
        potatoe bun, or the chicken shawarma. Oh, and don't scrimp on the selection of fresh, zingy dips and salads either - we say go for anything
        with beetroot and aubergine in it.

        <br>
      <p><b>What's the deal?</b> A kitsch cafe with a modern menu and a few unusual twists.
        <br>
          <b>Why go?</b> Enjoy contemporary dining in a retro setting. Menza means 'canteen' in English and thi hip decor is a nod to the country's
          Socialist era. But don't let that throw you - the food is anything but basic, with hightlights including cold strawberry soup, duck leg
          with ratatouille, and oven-baked kohlrabi stuffed with minced veal.

            <b>Where?</b> Liszt Ferenc ter 2, 1061, Hungary

        won't be the cheapest meal of your Budapest break, it's harn not to be impressed by what's available on the five-course and a la carte lists,
        whether it's lettuce soup with scallops or quail with pear barley and cranberries. The simple but flavourful desserts aren't to be missed.
